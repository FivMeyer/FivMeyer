With this personal repository I intend to demonstrate my skills in solving business challenges through my knowledge and tools of Data Science.

### Fernando Ivan Meyer
<sub>Graduated in Chemistry Bachelor and Post Graduate in Laboratories Management and Quality Control at the Universidade de Passo Fundo.</sub>

I have been studying Data Science since January 2021 and my main intention is to combine soft and hard skills, such as negotiation, communication, work and team management, programming, data management, and machine models for data-based decision making.

With that, I have been developing / proposing solutions to business problems in order to improve my analytical skills. In this journey I have already managed to develop sales forecasting models, groupings and customer segmentation, among others. The details of each solution are described in the following projects.
